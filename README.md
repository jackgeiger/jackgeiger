Hi, I’m @jackgeiger;
I’m interested in computer science and understanding how things work;
I’m currently learning quantum physics;
I’m currently planning to learn C/C++ as well as operating systems; I would like to spend some time perusing Linux/Ubuntu source code (if I can) to understand how they work;
