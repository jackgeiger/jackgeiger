Hi, I’m @jackgeiger<br>
I’m interested in computer science and understanding how things work<br>
I’m currently learning quantum physics<br>
I’m currently planning to learn C/C++ as well as operating systems; I would like to spend some time perusing Linux/Ubuntu source code (if I can) to understand how they work<br>
